# Transferring your R Shiny skills to Python

_PJ Van Camp - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjvancamp/)_

## Intro and Objectives

This repository contains materials used in the 'Transferring your R Shiny skills
to Python' workshop. The workshop aims to teach you how you can quickly start
building Shiny apps in Python if you already know R Shiny and have basic Python
coding skills.

This workshops has the following objectives:

- Describe the large conceptual overlap between R and Python Shiny
- Explain the differences between the Core and Express Python Shiny framework
- Demonstrate the power of Positron IDE for easily switching between R and
  Python Shiny
- Define decorators in Python and their use in the Shiny framework
- Convert core R Shiny functions (inputs, outputs, reactive environments) to
  Python syntax
- Build a few simple apps to showcase how easy the transition is
- Outline common R Shiny functionality that is not yet (fully) implemented in
  Python

## Repository Organisation

### Setup

[Setup Instructions](SETUP/README.MD) for your local or online development
environment are outlined in this README file.

### Topics

- PART 1 - [Creating Shiny UI](PART_1_UI/)
- PART 2 - [Python Shiny reactivity syntax](PART_2_reactivity/)
- PART 3 - [Shiny Express](PART_3_express/)
- PART 4 - [Interactive tables and plots](PART_4_Plotly-DataTable/)

Each part comes with a dedicated folder in this repository (see above):

- A README file will provide background information and boilerplate code
- One or more exercise folders will contain all code, data and instructions
  (again as a README) needed to complete the exercise
- Solutions to all exercises are available in the solutions folder. Try not to
  look at them when you get stuck, but rather look though the documentation

## Workshop Format

The workshop is broken down into 4 parts

For each part there will be

- 10-15 minutes introduction with a **tutorial**
- 20 minutes **hands-on exercises**
  - Instructions for each exercise are in a dedicated README
  - You can mute the sound as there will be a timer on the screen indication
    when the next part starts
  - The main room will be used to answer questions or help with debugging
  - Solutions to all exercises are available in the solutions folder, but try to
    solve the problem without looking at them
- 5 minutes **wrap-up** before moving on to the next part
