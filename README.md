# Transferring your R Shiny skills to Python

_PJ Van Camp_

## Intro and Objectives

This repository contains materials used in the 'Transferring your R Shiny skills
to Python' workshop. The workshop aims to teach you how you can quickly start
building Shiny apps in Python if you already know R Shiny and have basic Python
coding skills.

This workshops has the following objectives:

- Describe the large conceptual overlap between R and Python Shiny
- Explain the differences between the Core and Express Python Shiny framework
- Demonstrate the power of Positron IDE for easily switching between R and
  Python Shiny
- Define decorators in Python and their use in the Shiny framework
- Convert core R Shiny functions (inputs, outputs, reactive environments) to
  Python syntax
- Build a few simple apps to showcase how easy the transition is
- Outline common R Shiny functionality that is not yet (fully) implemented in
  Python

## Repository Organisation

- [Setup Instructions](SETUP/README.MD) for your local or online development
  environment are outlined in this document.
- The workshop is divided in **multiple parts, each with it's own dedicated
  folder** in this repo
  - A README file will provide background information and boilerplate code
  - One or more Exercise folders will contain all code, data and instructions
    needed to complete an exercise
- You can ignore the `docs` folder as this contains files to organise the repo
  and workshop but are not needed in any of the exercises
