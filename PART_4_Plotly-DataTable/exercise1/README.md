# PART 4 - Exercise 1 - Instructions

## Intro

You are building a simple To-Do tracker that allows you to create new tasks and
mark existing ones as completed. You are given an app that already allows you to
add new tasks.

## Tasks

- When a row is selected and the `completed` button is clicked, that task
  should get the current time as a timestamp in the last column
- When the button is clicked without a row being selected, nothing should happen

Tip: Check the section on working with
[reactive values](../../PART_2_reactivity/README.md) again if needed

## Expected output

_The first two tasks have been marked as completed_
